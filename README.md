## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

During this project i used css customed properties for the first time and it was really cool. It helped me avoid repition of the colors i used while working on the project.

See the example of what i'm talking about below:

```css
:root {
    --bg-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
body {
    background-color: var(--bg-color);
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

### Continued development

This project was quite easy because i had previous knowledge of how to perfectly center an element. But i still look forward to learing more about css grid, positioning, flexbox, and gradients. 

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for to learn how to center a div element. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
